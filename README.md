# Maxwells-Demon
Reciprocation of a Programmable Maxwell's Demon in VPython

- VPython7 has been used  
- By converting incoming streams of 0's to an outgoing mess of 0's and 1's, the engineered maxwell's demon generates enough entropy in the bits to enable the transformation of thermal energy into mechanical work. (read paper for detailed overview)
- The programmable Maxwell's demon (both autonomous and non-autonomous) is under construction, paper is attached.
